# List Invoices

Returns a list of invoices for a given location. The response
is paginated. If truncated, the response includes a `cursor` that you  
use in a subsequent request to retrieve the next set of invoices.

```ts
async listInvoices(
  locationId: string,
  cursor?: string,
  limit?: number,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions
): Promise<ApiResponse<ListInvoicesResponse>>
```

## Parameters

|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `locationId` | `string` | Query, Required | The ID of the location for which to list invoices. |
| `cursor` | `string \| undefined` | Query, Optional | A pagination cursor returned by a previous call to this endpoint.<br>Provide this cursor to retrieve the next set of results for your original query.<br><br>For more information, see [Pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/common-api-patterns/pagination). |
| `limit` | `number \| undefined` | Query, Optional | The maximum number of invoices to return (200 is the maximum `limit`).<br>If not provided, the server uses a default limit of 100 invoices. |

## Response Type

[`ListInvoicesResponse`](../../doc/models/list-invoices-response.md)

## Example Usage

```ts
const locationId = 'location_id4';

try {
  const { result, ...httpResponse } = await invoicesApi.listInvoices(locationId);
  // Get more response info...
  // const { statusCode, headers } = httpResponse;
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof ApiError) {
    const errors = error.result;
    // const { statusCode, headers } = error;
  }
}
```


# Create Invoice

Creates a draft [invoice](../../doc/models/invoice.md)
for an order created using the Orders API.

A draft invoice remains in your account and no action is taken.
You must publish the invoice before Square can process it (send it to the customer's email address or charge the customerâ€™s card on file).

```ts
async createInvoice(
  body: CreateInvoiceRequest,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions
): Promise<ApiResponse<CreateInvoiceResponse>>
```

that you use in a subsequent request to retrieve the next set of invoices.

```ts
async searchInvoices(
  body: SearchInvoicesRequest,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions
): Promise<ApiResponse<SearchInvoicesResponse>>
```

  invoiceId: string,
  body: CancelInvoiceRequest,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions

  }
}
```


# Publish Invoice

Publishes the specified draft invoice.

After an invoice is published, Square
follows up based on the invoice configuration. For example, Square
sends the invoice to the customer's email address, charges the customer's card on file, or does
nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted invoice page.

The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status
based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to `UNPAID` if
Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charges a card on file for a portion of the
invoice amount.

In addition to the required `ORDERS_WRITE` and `INVOICES_WRITE` permissions, `CUSTOMERS_READ`
and `PAYMENTS_WRITE` are required when publishing invoices configured for card-on-file payments.

```ts
async publishInvoice(
  invoiceId: string,
  body: PublishInvoiceRequest,
  requestOptions?: RequestOptions
): Promise<ApiResponse<PublishInvoiceResponse>>
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `invoiceId` | `string` | Template, Required | The ID of the invoice to publish. |
| `body` | [`PublishInvoiceRequest`](../../doc/models/publish-invoice-request.md) | Body, Required | An object containing the fields to POST for the request.<br><br>See the corresponding object definition for field details. |
| `requestOptions` | `RequestOptions \| undefined` | Optional | Pass additional request options. |

## Response Type
