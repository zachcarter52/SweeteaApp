     * A Square loyalty program maintains a ledger of events that occur during the lifetime of a
     * buyer's loyalty account. Each change in the point balance
     * (for example, points earned, points redeemed, and points expired) is
     * recorded in the ledger. Using this endpoint, you can search the ledger for events.
     *
     * Search results are sorted by `created_at` in descending order.
